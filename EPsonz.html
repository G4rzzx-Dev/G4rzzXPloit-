    <h3><i class="fa-solid fa-circle-info"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;Definition of Deface</h3>
      <p>Deface/Defacing is one of the web hacking that focuses on changing the appearance of a website. The change in the appearance of the website can include all pages of the website or just part of it such as changing the content, font size, images, etc. This deface technique is a technique that is often used for initial testing of web security because this web deface can run if a vulnerability is found in the security system such as the HTML entity of the website. This deface is a result of cracking the website. Deface is done by reading the source code and then changing or adding the code to change the appearance of the website.

  <h3><i class="fa-solid fa-backward"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;History of Deface</h3>
  
<p>Deface is an attack in which the perpetrator changes the appearance of a website illegally. This phenomenon began to appear in <br> the early days of the internet, when website security was still very minimal.</p>

<p><b>1. 1990s:</b><br>
In this decade, websites began to become popular, especially after the World Wide Web was invented by Tim Berners-Lee in 1991. <br>
Hackers in this era were often considered "experimental" because they attacked websites only to show system weaknesses <br> without the intention of stealing data or causing major losses.</p>

<p><b>2. First Defacement Case (1996):</b><br>
One of the first recorded cases of defacement was the hacking of the CIA website by a hacker group calling themselves "Hacktivists." <br> The hackers replaced the site's pages with satirical messages against the United States government.</p>

<p><b>3. The Rise of Hacktivism:</b><br>
In the late 1990s and early 2000s, the defacement phenomenon evolved into a tool for voicing political and social protests. <br>
Famous examples are the groups Anonymous and LulzSec, who often deface government or large corporate sites to convey their messages.</p>

<p><b>4. Development of Deface Techniques:</b><br>
Initially, deface attacks were carried out using simple methods such as accessing FTP servers using default passwords. <br>
Over time, attack techniques have become more sophisticated, such as using SQL Injection, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), <br> or exploiting vulnerabilities in Content Management Systems (CMS) such as WordPress and Joomla.</p>

<p><b>5. Modern Era (2000s to present):</b><br>
Defacement is not only an individual action, but also a collective action by international hacker groups.
A major example is the mass <br> defacement attack on various government sites in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, where hackers from both sides attacked each other's sites.
</p>
  
  <h3><i class="fa-solid fa-question"></i>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;Purpose of defacement</h3>
    
  <p><b>1. Showing Security Weaknesses</b><br>
As explained above, deface/defacing is often used for initial testing of web security,<br> so the goal is to show that there are gaps in the web security system which allows <br> hackers to easily change the appearance of the web.</p>

<p><b>2. Making a Protest or Criticism</b><br>
You must know one of the types of hackers, namely hacktivists. Hacktivists themselves often carry out their actions by using <br> deface techniques. Hacktivists will change the appearance of the web as a form of protest by displaying propaganda or writing their goals.</p>

<p><b>3. Selling Products</b><br>
In addition to the above, this deface is also often used for personal interests of hackers. <br> One example is by replacing the web page with a web page that they use to sell products etc.</p>

<p><b>4. For Personal Pleasure</b><br>
Apart from selling products, hackers also deface just for their personal pleasure and to show off their skills.</p>

    <h2 id="Ddos" translate="no">2. DDoS </h2>
    <h3><i class="fa-solid fa-circle-info"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;Definition of DDoS</h3>
  <p>DDoS or Distributed Denial of Service is a cyberattack in which many malware-infected devices or computers (often called bots or zombies) are used simultaneously to flood a target server, service, or network with so much traffic that the system cannot operate normally. The main goal of this attack is to stop a service or website from being accessed by legitimate users.</p>
      
  <br><br>
    <div class="picture">
      <h3><i class="fa-solid fa-image"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;Images</h3>

      <img src ="Gambar/Ddos3.png" width="330" weight="450">
      </div>
  <br><br>
      
      <h3><i class="fa-solid fa-gear"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;How DDoS Work</h3>

<h3>1. Botnet Formation:</h3> 
<p>The attacker first builds a botnet, which is a collection of devices (computers, servers, or IoT) that have been taken over by malware. <br> These devices work under the attacker's control without the owner's knowledge.</p>

<h3>2. Attack Coordination:</h3>
<p>The botnet is directed to send a large number of requests to the target server at the same time.</p>

<h3>3. Server Overload:</h3>
<p>The target server becomes overloaded due to receiving requests far beyond its capacity to handle.</p>


<h3>4. Service Disruption:</h3>
<p>Due to overload, the server or network becomes slow or cannot be accessed at all.
</p>
<p>During a DDoS attack, a series of bots, or botnets, flood a website or service with http requests and traffic. Essentially, multiple computers swarm a single computer during an attack, driving out legitimate users. As a result, services may be delayed or disrupted for a period of time. Hackers may also be able to infiltrate your database during the attack and access sensitive information. DDoS attacks can exploit security vulnerabilities and target any endpoint that is reachable, publicly, over the internet. DDoS attacks can last for hours, or even days. These cyberattacks can also cause multiple outages during a single attack. Both personal and business devices are vulnerable to these attacks.</p>

  <h2 id="Osint" translate="no">3. OSINT</h2>
    <h3><i class="fa-solid fa-circle-info"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;Definition of OSINT</h3>
    <p>OSINT (Open Source Intelligence) is the process of collecting and analyzing information from publicly available open sources. These sources can be the  internet, social media, public documents, news, forums, and even video or audio recordings. OSINT is often used by security researchers, companies,  government agencies, and individuals for various purposes, such as investigations, threat mapping, or research.

<p><b>1. World War II (1939–1945) :</b><br>
OSINT first became officially known during World War II. Military intelligence gathered information from enemy radio broadcasts, newspapers, and mass media to understand enemy strategies. One example is the British intelligence agency, the Government Code and Cypher School (GC & CS), which used public information as part of their analysis.</p>

<p><b>2. Cold War (1947–1991) :</b><br>
At that time, gathering information from open sources became more important because of the difficulty of accessing enemy territory.
Intelligence agencies such as the CIA and KGB used scientific publications, economic reports, and mass media to understand enemy strengths.</p>

<p><b>3. Internet Era (1990s) :</b><br>
The Internet became the main source of OSINT. Information that was previously difficult to access became easier to obtain through websites, forums, and other digital data.
An early example of the use of OSINT in cyberspace was data mining to analyze cybersecurity threats and map criminal networks.</p>

<p><b> 4. Modern OSINT :</b><br>
Today, OSINT is used by security agencies, companies, and individuals for a variety of purposes, such as investigations, law enforcement, and cybersecurity.
Modern OSINT tools, such as Maltego, Shodan, or SpiderFoot, allow users to collect data from social media, DNS, and IP in seconds.

    <h3><i class="fa-solid fa-question"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;Purpose of OSINT</h3>

<p><b>Cybersecurity :</b> Detecting potential threats to a system or network.</p>

<p><b>Criminal Investigation :</b> Tracking activities or individuals related to crime.</p>

<p><b>Corporate Reputation :</b> Monitoring public opinion or threats to a brand.</p>

<p><b>Military Intelligence :</b> Collecting information to support national security strategies.</p>

<h2 id="Phising" translate="no">4. Phising</h2>
    <h3><i class="fa-solid fa-circle-info"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;Definition of Phising</h3> 
  <p>Phishing is a cybercrime committed to obtain personal information illegally. The term phishing comes from the English word fishing, which means "Fishing". In phishing, the perpetrator will pretend to be a trusted person or organization to obtain personal information such as passwords, account numbers, or other sensitive data. This information is then used to commit fraud, identity theft, or other criminal activities. Phishing activities are indeed intended to lure people to provide personal information voluntarily without realizing it. In fact, the information shared will be used for criminal purposes.</p>

  <br><br>

    <h3><i class="fa-solid fa-bug"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;Types Of Phising</h3>
    To better understand phishing, let's learn about the most common types of phishing today: <br><br>

<p><b>1. Email Phishing :</b><br>
As the name implies, email phishing uses email to reach potential victims.
The number of phishing emails is quite large. According to data, there are 3.4 billion fake emails sent every day. You can imagine how many victims can fall into this trap.</p>

<p><b>Example Email spoofing :</b><br>
The attacker impersonates the real address of the website with an email from the header. For example, the real email address is dave@exampleoriginalwebsite.com, while the fake email address is _dave@exampleoriginalwebsite.org.</p>

<p><b>2. Spear Phishing</b><br>
Spear phishing is a type of email phishing. The difference is, instead of using massive email delivery to random potential victims, spear phishing targets specific potential victims. Usually, this technique is carried out after some basic information about the <br> potential victim is obtained, such as name and address.</p>

<p><b>3. Whaling</b><br>
Whaling is a phishing step that not only targets specific individuals, but also individuals who have high authority in an organization, such as business owners, company directors, personnel managers, and others. Thus, if this whaling action is successful, there will be many benefits that can be utilized from the access obtained.</p>

<p><b>4. Web Phishing</b><br>
Web phishing is an attempt to use a fake website to trick potential victims. The website for phishing will look similar to the official website and use a similar domain name. This is called domain spoofing.</p>

<p><b>Example Domain spoofing :</b><br>
The attacker creates a fake website with a URL that looks like the real URL. For example, replacing "google.com" with "go0gle.com".</p>

<h4><i class="fa-solid fa-gear"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;How Phising Works</h4>

<p>The way phishing works is that the perpetrator starts by determining who the victim will be and creating a strategy to collect data that can be used in the attack. After that, what the phishing perpetrator does is create a fake email in the name of the admin or a fake web page that is very similar to the original website. The perpetrator then sends a message that looks trustworthy and starts the attack. After the attack is carried out, the perpetrator will monitor and collect data provided by the victim on the fake web page. Then, the perpetrator uses the data obtained from the victim to make illegal purchases or carry out other fraudulent actions.</p>

  <h2 id="Rat" translate="no">5. Remote Access Trojan</h2>
  <h3><i class="fa-solid fa-circle-info"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;Definition of RAT</h3>
   <p>A Remote Access Trojan (RAT) is a malware program that opens a backdoor, allowing administrative control over a victim’s computer. RATs are typically downloaded along with seemingly legitimate programs, such as games, or sent to targets as email attachments. Once an attacker has compromised a host system, they can use it to distribute the RAT to other vulnerable computers, forming a botnet.</p>

<p>RATs can be deployed as malicious payloads using exploit tools such as Metasploit. Upon successful installation, the RAT gains direct connectivity to a command and control (C&C) server, controlled by the attacker. The attacker does this using a pre-defined open TCP port on the compromised device.</p>

<div class="picture">
  <h3><i class="fa-solid fa-image"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;Images</h3>
      <img src="Gambar/Rat2.png" width="330" weight="350">

      &nbsp;&nbsp;
      <img src ="Gambar/Rat3.jpg" width="330" weight="350">
  </div>

<h4>Because RATs provide administrative control, attackers can do almost anything on the victim's computer, for example:</h4><br><br>

<div class="container-list">
  <ul class="custom-list">
    <p>
      <span class="custom-bullet"></span>
      Monitoring user behavior through spyware or keylogger
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="custom-bullet"></span>
      Access sensitive data, including phone numbers, social security and credit cards
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="custom-bullet"></span>
     Enable video recording, webcam system and Take screenshots
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="custom-bullet"></span>
      Distributing malware and viruses
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="custom-bullet"></span>
      Formatting the drive
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="custom-bullet"></span>
    Downloading, modifying, or deleting files and file systems
    </p>
  </ul>
</div>

<h4><i class="fa-solid fa-gear"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;How RATs Work</h4>

<p><b>RATs can spread in a variety of ways, with the goal of infiltrating a system without the user or administrator knowing. Here are some common methods of spread :</b></p>

<p><b>1. Via Email Or Application:</b><br>
Attackers often use phishing emails that include malicious attachments or links to malicious websites. These attachments or links, once opened or downloaded, will install the RAT on the victim's system.</p>

<p><b>2. Via Counterfeit Software:</b><br>
RATs can be embedded in pirated software or applications that mimic legitimate software.
When users install such software, they also unknowingly install the RAT. </p>

<p><b>3. Via Security Vulnerabilities:</b><br>
Attackers can exploit security vulnerabilities in outdated or unpatched software.
Through these vulnerabilities, the RAT can be embedded in a system without the user's knowledge.</p>
